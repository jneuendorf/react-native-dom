# react-native-dom
Complete React Native API for the browser for easier React Native App development

The goal is to be able to start the app in the browser by only replacing `import {...} from 'react-native'` by `import {...} from 'react-native-dom'` (and having an according build process obviously).

It has lots in common with [react-native-web]() but does not aim to perfect visualization.
Rather it aims for providing the complete React Native API.
Thus the behavior of an app can be developed and tested quickly without the need to have an app development environment.
